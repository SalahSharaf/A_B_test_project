# A_B_test_project

it was udacity capstone project of mastering explainatory analysis and statistics with python

## data

<br/>
in this project i have dealed with data from a store that wand to marketing decision about their page 
to finally decide if the new page have made more coversion rate than the old page
<br>

### i have made the same decision based on A/B test and machine learning algorthim which was the logistic regression 

<br>

## the final result:

i have answered the question and the new page dosn't have any statistical evidence that it's better than the old one 
so building another web page to test would be better


### thanks for checking out and your consideration
